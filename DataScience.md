## Project 2: Unsupervised Image Seqmentation
<p><b>Objective</b>:<br>
Use k-means clustering for image segmentation and to identify dominant color in the image.<br><br>

<b>Question</b>:<br>
Display the image “dog.jpeg”. Convert the image in to numpy array, so that it can be used in further processing<br>
Find out the dimensions of the image and convert it in to a two-dimensional array<br>
Use kmeans clustering with k set to 5 and cluster the image<br>
Predict the cluster label of every pixel in the image and plot it back as an image<br>
Find out the five dominant color in the image</p>

## Project 3: Time Series Analysis
<p>Domain – SEA Transportation focus – <b>forecast demand Business challenge/requirement</b> <br><br>

SeaPort is the largest operator of Sea Planes across sea shores in Europe.<br>
SeaPort doesn't have planes of their own, rather they lease themon a short-term basis based on passenger traffic. You as an ML expert have to builda model to forecast the demand (passenger traffic) of traffic.<br><br>

<b>Key issues</b><br>
As of now utilization of Planes is low due to poor forecasts of traffic<br><br>

<b>Considerations</b><br>
NONE<br><br>

<b>Data volume</b><br>
Approx 144 records–data month wise for last 12 years – file SeaPlaneTravel.csv<br>
<b>Fields in Data</b><br>
Month: Month in which traffic data was recorded<br>
'#Passenger': No of travellers availing Service in that month<br>
<b>Additional information</b><br>
-NA<br><br>

<b>Business benefits</b><br>
Better utilization of planes will lead to decrease in cost and hence better bottom line</p>

## Project 4: Association Rule Mining
<p><b>Market Basket Analysis</b> There is an online transactional data of a retail store containing the information of different items sold in different countries<br><br>
<b>Key Issue</b> As of now the company doesn't have a robust rule to club the items to maximize its sell Goal. You as an ML expert have to build a model to develop association rules, using online transaction data of retail store, with their corresponding support, confidence and lift values<br><br>

<b>Strategy</b> Deploy apriori algorithm </p>

## Project 5: Breast Cancer Prediction
<br>
<p>Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a <b>breast mass</b>.<br> <b>Attribute Information</b>:<br>
  1) ID number<br>2) Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign)<br>
  3-32) Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:<br>

a) <b>radius</b> (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter) b) <b>texture</b> (standard deviation of gray-scale values) c) <b>perimeter</b> d) <b>area</b> e) <b>smoothness</b> (local variation in radius lengths) f) <b>compactness</b> (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0) g) <b>concavity</b> (severity of concave portions of the contour) h) <b>concave points</b> (number of concave portions of the contour) i) <b>symmetry</b> j) <b>fractal dimension</b> ("coastline approximation" - 1) <br><br>

The <b>mean</b>, <b>standard error</b> and <b>"worst"</b> or <b>largest</b> (mean of the three largest values) of these features were computed for each image, resulting in <b>30</b> features. For instance, field <b>3</b> is <b>Mean Radius</b>, <b>field 13</b> is <b>Radius SE</b>, <b>field 23</b> is <b>Worst Radius</b>.<br><br>

All feature values are recoded with four significant digits<br><br>

Missing attribute values: none<br><br>

Class distribution: 357 benign, 212 malignant.</p>
