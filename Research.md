Throughout my academic, industrial and professional journey, I have cultivated a diverse portfolio of projects spanning several exciting disciplines. From the intricate world of **Bioinformatics** and the complexities of **Biophysics**, **Biochemistry**, and **Molecular Biology**, to the fascinating realm of **DNA Nanotechnology**, I've delved into projects that have allowed me to explore and contribute to a rich tapestry of scientific knowledge. I've also explored the vital field of **Biostatistics** and harnessed the power of **Data Science** to extract valuable insights from complex datasets. These experiences have not only broadened my horizons but have also deepened my passion for interdisciplinary research and problem-solving in the fields of life sciences and data analysis.
