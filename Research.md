Throughout my academic, industrial and professional journey, I have cultivated a diverse portfolio of projects spanning several exciting disciplines. From the intricate world of **Bioinformatics** and the complexities of **Biophysics**, **Biochemistry**, and **Molecular Biology**, to the fascinating realm of **DNA Nanotechnology**, I've delved into projects that have allowed me to explore and contribute to a rich tapestry of scientific knowledge. I've also explored the vital field of **Biostatistics** and harnessed the power of **Data Science** to extract valuable insights from complex datasets. These experiences have not only broadened my horizons but have also deepened my passion for interdisciplinary research and problem-solving in the fields of life sciences and data analysis.

I, under the supervision of Dr. Dipankar Sen, worked with d(C2G4) repeat DNA sequence to discover a novel DNA secondary structure, named, iCD-DNA, with potential causal implication in Neurodegenrative Disorders. Here is the description:

* [(C2G4)n repeat expansion sequences from the C9orf72 gene form an unusual DNA higher-order structure in the pH range of 5-6](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198418)
  Massive expansion of a DNA hexanucleotide sequence repeat (C2G4) within the human C9orf72 gene has been linked to a number of neurodegenerative diseases. In sodium or potassium salt solutions,
  single-stranded d(C2G4)n DNAs fold to form G-quadruplexes. We have found that in magnesium or lithium salt solutions, especially under slightly acidic conditions,
  d(C2G4)n oligonucleotides fold to form a distinctive higher order structure whose most striking feature is an "inverted" circular dichroism spectrum, which is
  distinguishable from the spectrum of the left handed DNA double-helix, Z-DNA. On the basis of CD spectroscopy, gel mobility as well as chemical protection analysis,
  we propose that this structure, which we call "iCD-DNA", may be a left-handed Hoogsteen base-paired duplex, an unorthodox G-quadruplex/i-motif composite, or a non-canonical,
  "braided" DNA triplex. Given that iCD-DNA forms under slightly acidic solution conditions, we do not know at this point in time whether or not it forms within living cells.
